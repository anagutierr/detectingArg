- intent: waste
  examples: |
    - If we do not provide Universal basic pension, many elderly citizens will struggle to make ends meet and may fall into poverty. If we allow elderly citizens to fall into poverty despite their years of contribution, that would be a waste of their lifetime efforts to support themselves and their families. Therefore, we ought to provide Universal basic pension to ensure that elderly citizens can live with dignity and avoid wasting their lifetime efforts.
    - If children are denied internet access, all the previous efforts made towards incorporating technology into education will be wasted. If those efforts towards incorporating technology into education are wasted, children will be ill-prepared for the increasingly technology-dependent future job market. Therefore, children ought to be provided internet access to ensure that the previous efforts towards incorporating technology in education are not wasted and that they are equipped for the future job market.
    - If social networks stop trying to realize the implementation of censorship now, all social networks' previous efforts to realize the implementation of censorship will be wasted. If all social networks' previous attempts to realize the implementation of censorship are wasted, that would be a bad thing. Therefore, social networks ought to continue trying to realize the implementation of censorship.
    - If we stop trying to address climate change now, all previous efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change will be wasted. If all our previous efforts to address climate change are wasted, the planet will continue to face devastating consequences such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and wildlife extinction. Therefore, we ought to continue striving towards a sustainable future and actively combat the causes and effects of climate change.
    - If we continue to focus on reducing carbon emissions, it will be a waste of resources as climate change is a natural occurrence and beyond our control. If we continue to allocate resources towards reducing carbon emissions when it is not necessary, it will divert resources away from other important areas like medical research and poverty reduction. Therefore, we should stop trying to reduce carbon emissions in order to allocate resources towards areas where real progress can be made.
    - If society stops trying to realize true meritocracy now, all society's previous efforts to realize true meritocracy will be wasted. If all society’s previous attempts to realize true meritocracy are wasted, that would be a bad thing. Therefore, society ought to continue trying to realize true meritocracy instead of implementing gender quotas.
    - If we stop trying to develop full self-driving cars now, all the resources and efforts invested in their development will be wasted. Wasting all the previous resources and efforts put into the development of full self-driving cars would be a significant loss for the industry and society as a whole, as it could represent a missed opportunity to revolutionize transportation and improve safety on our roads. Therefore, we ought to continue investing in the development of full self-driving cars to fully realize their potential benefits and prevent the loss of previous progress and resources.
    - If a person is executed for a crime, and it is later discovered that they were innocent, their life will have been needlessly taken and their potential for rehabilitation and contributions to society will be lost.

    - If countries stop participating in globalization now, all the efforts made towards achieving economic integration, cultural exchange and technological advancement will be wasted. If the previous efforts towards globalization are wasted, it would amount to loss of immense opportunities for growth and progress for the entire world. Therefore, countries should continue to participate in globalization to make the most of the progress made thus far and to continue the journey towards achieving a global community that is more interconnected and interdependent.
    - If countries continue to allow offshore tax havens, all previous efforts to crack down on tax evasion will be wasted. If efforts to crack down on tax evasion are wasted, that would be a bad thing because it results in lost revenue for governments and exacerbates income inequality. Therefore, countries ought to take action to eliminate offshore tax havens and prevent further tax evasion.
    - If society continues to adhere to political correctness, it will suppress the free exchange of ideas and stifle intellectual discourse.

    - If countries stop using capital punishment as a form of justice now, all previous executions will have been for nothing. If all previous executions were for nothing, the victims' families may feel that justice was not served and the deterrence effect on potential criminals will be lost, leading to more crime. Therefore, countries ought to continue using capital punishment as a form of justice to honor the victims and deter potential criminals.
    - If we do not increase taxes now, all the previous efforts to reduce the national debt will be wasted.

Therefore, prostitution should be legalized to ensure that the efforts made by sex workers to earn a living are not wasted, and that overall societal benefit may be achieved through legalization and regulation of the sex industry.
    - If people use birth control, they will be preventing the birth of potential human beings. If all the potential human beings are prevented from being born, the human race will eventually go extinct.

    - There is a choice in 2021 between enforcing stricter laws on freedom of speech and not enforcing stricter laws. At 2021, I am pre-committed to enforcing stricter laws on freedom of speech because of what I did or committed myself to in 2015 when I defended that limiting hate speech was essential to preserve peace in our society. Therefore, I should choose to enforce stricter laws on freedom of speech.
    - There is a choice at present between imposing tariffs on imported products and not imposing tariffs. At past times, countries have invested a considerable amount of resources in establishing industries that produce products that can compete with imported products. Therefore, imposing tariffs on imported products is necessary to protect the sunk costs that countries have already invested in their domestic industries and ensure that those industries remain viable.
    - There is a choice in the current democratic environment between upholding political correctness and neglecting political correctness. In the past, I am pre-committed to candid frankness and open-expression of ideas, even if it means disregarding political correctness, because of the free speech movement I supported in my youth.

    - There is a choice in 2022 between having a school uniform and not having a school uniform. In 2021, I am pre-committed to not having a school uniform because of the substantial amount I spent on casual clothing for school. Therefore, I should choose not having a school uniform.
    - There is a choice at present between accepting the existence of UFOs and rejecting it as a hoax or illusion. At some point in the past, significant investment has been made in research, investigations, and collection of data on UFO sightings and encounters. This includes not only time and effort but also financial resources that cannot be recovered if UFOs are ultimately dismissed as non-existent. Therefore, given the sunk costs invested in exploring the possibility of UFO existence, we should continue to accept that they are a genuine phenomenon and invest further resources in studying them.
    - There is a choice in 2022 between legalizing cannabis and not legalizing it. At past times, significant amounts of money and resources have been spent on enforcing laws against cannabis, such as hiring and training police officers, equipping them with vehicles and tools, creating a system of courts and judges, and building prisons to house offenders. Therefore, legalizing cannabis would be a poor choice, as all the resources and money spent in the past would have been wasted on an ineffective prohibition policy.
    - There is a choice in 2023 between continuing genetic manipulation projects and halting all genetic manipulation projects. In 2023, we are pre-committed to halting all genetic manipulation projects because of the enormous resources and funding we had allocated for public health programs and ethical research studies in 2020. Therefore, we should choose to halt all genetic manipulation projects.
    - There is a choice in 2021 between embracing Globalization and promoting local businesses. In 2000, we pre-committed to establishing local industries and economy because of what we did or committed ourselves to at that time. Therefore, we should choose promoting local businesses.
    - There is a choice between continuing with Intermittent fasting or stopping it. I have invested a significant amount of time and effort in learning about Intermittent fasting, planning meals, and adjusting to the diet. Therefore, I should continue with Intermittent fasting even if I face some challenges or inconvenience, as stopping now would waste the sunk costs of my past efforts and diminish the benefits that I have already gained.
    - There is a choice at the beginning of a sexual relationship between using birth control or not using birth control. At the beginning of the sexual relationship, I have already invested time and resources into the relationship and have made a commitment to protect myself and my partner from unwanted pregnancy by using birth control. Therefore, I should continue to use birth control throughout the sexual relationship to honor my previous investment and commitment.
    - There is a choice in 2022 between investing in Sustainable Development Goals and not investing in Sustainable Development Goals. In 2022, I am pre-committed to not investing in Sustainable Development Goals because of what I did or committed myself to in 2020. Therefore, I should choose not investing in Sustainable Development Goals.
