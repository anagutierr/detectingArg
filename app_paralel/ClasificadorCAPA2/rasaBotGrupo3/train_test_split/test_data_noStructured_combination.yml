Therefore, we ought to continue striving towards a sustainable future and actively combat the causes and effects of climate change.
    - If we continue to focus on reducing carbon emissions, it will be a waste of resources as climate change is a natural occurrence and beyond our control.

Therefore, we should stop trying to reduce carbon emissions in order to allocate resources towards areas where real progress can be made.
    - If society stops trying to realize true meritocracy now, all society's previous efforts to realize true meritocracy will be wasted.
